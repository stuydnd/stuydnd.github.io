      <h3 id="prime">The Prime Material</h3>
      <hr class="b3">
      <p>
        <p>The <b>Prime Material</b> plane contains all of the worlds that form the default settings for most D&D campaigns. Prime Material worlds are inhabited by tangible beings made of flesh and blood or sometimes metal.  Magic works as described in the rulebooks. Gods deserve worship and their followers advance causes in their names, but gods themselves are abstract and not interacted with directly. When creatures die, their souls travel elsewhere and their bodies begin to decompose.  Elements and concepts, such as fire, water, magic, fear, are all present in different combinations, but the world is not a manifestation of any one concept or elements. The Prime may comprise a steampunk world, a high fantasy world, or even 21st-century earth.  It essentially functions like our own real-world universe; an enormous mass of space with stars, moons and planets in it, with the various campaign settings being inhabitable Earth-like planets within this universe. This makes it the most "normal" of the various planes.

        <p><b>The Feywild</b>, also calIed <b>the Plane of Faerie</b>, is a land
          of soft lights and wonder, a country of little people with
          great desires, a place of music and death. It is a realm
          of eternal twilight, with slow lanterns bobbing in the
          gentle breeze and huge fireflies buzzing through graves
          and fields. The sky is alight with the faded colors of
          the setting, or perhaps rising, sun. But, in fact, the sun
          never truly sets or rises; it remains stationary, dusky
          and low in the sky. Away fram the settled areas ruled by
          the Seelie Court, lhe land is a tangle of sharp-toothed
          brambles and syrupy fens-perfect territory for the
          Unseelie to hunt their prey. Fey creatures, such as those
          brought to the world by conjure woad/and beings and
          similar spelIs, dwell in the Feywild.

      <p><b>The Shadowfell</b>, also called the <b>Plane of Shadow</b>, is
        a darkly lighted dimension, a world of black and white
        where color has been leached from everything. It is a
        place of toxic darkness that hates the light, where the
        sky is a black vault with neither sun nor stars.</p>

      <h2 id="inner">The Inner Planes</h2>
      <hr class="b2">
      <p>The Inner Planes, aka the Elemental Planes, are manifestations of elemental forces such as fire, wind, and earth.  The Inner Planes may be reached via magic or portals, or via vortices, which connect to locations embodying the extreme nature of the corresponding element in the Prime Material Plane.  For example, the center of a tornado may be a vortex that leads to the Plane of Air, or the center of a volcano a Vortex leading to the Plane of Fire.</p>
      <h3 id="fire">The Elemental Plane of Fire</h3>
      <hr class="b3">
      <img src="https://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/istria/images/9/97/City_of_Brass.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/2000?cb=20130726002517" width="400">
      <p>As the name suggests, <b>the Plane of Fire </b> is hot – very hot.
      The air is suffused with fire, so creatures and objects that
      are not protected against the extreme temperatures are
      going to suffer. The suffering should be enough to force
      visitors to take precautions without burning them to a
      crisp upon arrival – characters still need to visit the plane
      in order to partake in its treasures, after all.</p>
      <p>The nature of the plane has created a realm where the
        landscape is dominated by several distinct geographic
        features. The Sea of Fire is a molten ocean of burning lava.
        The fiery waves crash against rocky islands and eventually
        wear those down to lava as well, and as some waves crest
        high enough they cool quickly enough to form new islands.
        This pattern of cooling and melting is common, and wise
        travelers know not to rely on any given island of burnt rock
        for too long.</p>
        <p>Beyond the Sea of Fire lays the bulk of the plane known
          as the Cinder Wastes. This vast plain of baked and arid
          dust is dangerous to traverse, with titanic cracks in the
          earth appearing with a moment’s notice to spew lava from
          the plane’s depths onto the surface. This effect is known
          as a lava geyser, as the result is often spectacular and
          dangerous for anyone nearby. Upon this wasteland rests hills, mountains, and valleys upon the crimson horizon.</p>
          <p>The largest chain of volcanoes on the Plane of Fire are
          known as the Fountains of Creation, which is the realm’s
          closest point to the Plane of Earth. The azer are known to
          dwell here, working titanic forges in the hearts of the most
          violent volcanoes to create wondrous items sought after
          across the multiverse. Many red dragons are known to
          make their lairs among these volcanoes as well.</p>
          <p>Ash is another problem, and in some areas great
          billowing clouds – some as large as a city - spread across
          the burnt landscape. Choking is a real danger for anyone
          caught in one of these ash clouds, and the sky is filled with
          slowly moving black masses of them. They can obscure
          light just like a regular cloud and can reduce visibility from
          hazy to nearly black.</p>
          <p>Inhabitants: Fire genasi, Azers, red dragonborn, red kobolds</p>
      <h3 id="air">The Elemental Plane of Air</h3>
      <hr class="b3">
      <img src="https://i.imgur.com/9IVHzxe.jpg" width="400">
      <p>The vast majority of the <b> Plane of Air </b> is comprised of a
        complex maze of wind gusts and air streams known as
        the Labyrinth Winds. This creates invisible paths that
        push and pull travelers and natives alike along certain
        courses, and the canny flyer knows to use the currents
        as a propellant rather than trying to move against them.
        Finding the right channel and then following its gale is a
        difficult skill for non-native creatures to master, but with
        a combination of magic, training, and luck, the Labyrinth
        Winds can be navigated.</p>
        <p>The Labyrinth Winds holds various independent realms, such as Aaqa, the Confederation of Calypso, and various
            djinn citadels and strongholds. Many of these realms are
            hidden away from view by magic and the natural properties
            of the plane, requiring specific actions or magic to reach.
            Great clouds of all color, from blue to purple to red and
            orange, dot the never-ending landscape of boundless blue,
            and behind some of them lurk treasures and dangers of all
            sorts.</p>
      <p>Where the Plane of Air nears the Plane of Water, the
        azure sky grows colder and the earth motes are joined
        by large ice chunks. This region is known as the Mistral
        Reach and is infrequently traveled – the snowstorms
        and blizzards that occur with only a moment’s notice
        are dangerous for flying creatures and vessels to handle.
        Beyond the Mistral Reach a traveler can eventually arrive
        at the border between the planes of Air and Water known
        as the Place of Ice.</p>
        <p>At the opposite end of the endless plane, the Plane of
          Fire heats up the air and creates an area known as the
          Sirocco Straits. Hot gusts whip sand and grit around,
          polishing the earth motes that dot the region, but it is a
          favorite staging ground for gargoyles and the Elemental
          Lords of Earth to mount attacks on their sworn flying
          enemies. The Grand Sultan of the Efreet is known to have
          a remote palace in the Sirocco Straits. The Plane of Ash,
          with its continual lightning storms and ash-choked sky,
          rests beyond the Sirocco Straits, and native creatures
          avoid getting to close to it.</p>

      <h3 id="water">The Elemental Plane of Water</h3>
      <hr class="b3">
      <img src="https://i.imgur.com/n79iLFt.jpg" width="400">
      <p>The <b> Plane of Water </b> is a vast realm of deep mysteries,
      shadowed darkness, and wondrous life, all combined
      into one of the most recognizable elements across the
      multiverse. Life flourishes in this plane, which many
      travelers can relate to on some level – after all, most
      Material Plane worlds have seas and oceans, so it’s too
      hard to imagine a vast, endless version of it.</p>
      <p>But the Plane of Water holds so much more, and it is
        one of the most hospitable of the Inner Planes to natural
        life (second only to the Plane of Air). With a little magic,
        travelers can dive into the Sea of Worlds and seek out
        the wonders and treasures of the Great Coral Forest, the
        wrecks of lost ships in the Graveyard of Sails, the reckless
        and arrogant halls of the marid genies in the Citadel of
        Ten Thousand Pearls, or even trade goods and services
        under the icy dome of the City of Glass. Deeper still lies
        dangerous lairs of cold, unyielding monsters, such as the
        Fathomless Caves and the Trench of Death.</p>
      <p>Sahuagin, marid genies, kuo-toa, merrow, and all
        manner of other creatures occupy the Plane of Water, and
        some have built cities and bases beneath the waves. And
        while most of the planar activity is underwater, contrary
        to most beliefs, the Plane of Water has a surface, and this
        surface is broken by several islands. The most famous of
        these islands is the Isle of Dread, surrounded by a fierce
        storm that extends to many Material Planes, which has
        the capability to draw in ships and strand them. The island
        itself is a dangerous, jungle-filled wilderness with great
        dinosaurs competing for food.</p>

      <p>Earth is a fundamental component of the multiverse and
      perhaps the most visible to most inhabitants of the Material
      Planes. Continents, islands, mountains, hills – these are all
      concrete examples of this ubiquitous element across the
      realms, and it shows up in all of the other Inner Planes as
      well in one form or another. And the root for all that rock
      and dirt is the <b> Plane of Earth.</b></p>
      <p>Much of this plane is solid mass making it difficult for
      non-native creatures to move around or even breathe.
      However, limitless tunnels, passages, and caves wind their
      way through the stony realm, the result of both incursions
      from other Inner Planes and determined digging efforts by
      the native creatures. The dao, genies of the earth, are the
      cruelest of slave drivers and constantly seek out veins of rich
      minerals and ore to adorn their fabulous abodes.</p>
      <p>Getting lost in the Plane of Earth is perhaps the greatest
        threat to travelers beyond a collapsing tunnel or marauding
        beast as there is no clear indication of any cardinal
        direction. Tunnels wind up and down, cross between each
        other, and cut into massive caves with no discernable
        pattern or thought. For travelers willing to risk the journey,
        however, great treasures and wonders can be found.</p>

      <p>The <b>Paraelemental Plane of Ice</b> (also known as <b>The Frostfell</b>) is the place where air and water meet.

      <p>The <b>Paraelemental Plane of Smoke</b> (also known as <b>The Great Conflagration</b>) is the place where air and fire meet. The Paraelemental Plane of Smoke is similar to the Elemental Plane of Air, having someone subjective directional gravity. The major difference is that it is an endless realm of hot, choking vapors that are endlessly foul smelling and quite harmful. Finding solid ground is a rare and valuable thing, and is usually nothing more than a floating cinder of gigantic proportions. Combustible clouds roam the plane, occasionally meeting a flickering flame or burning cinder and causing violent explosions. Throughout most of the plane, it is frighteningly difficult to see, and even darkvision gives off distorted images due to the intense heat. </p>

      <p>Where the Elemental Plane of Earth is saturated by
        the radiance of the Positive Energy Plane, the quasiplane of
        Mineral is born. This is the multiverse's treasure trove, filled
        with jewels, gems, and all manner of valuable crystals.
        Many leatherheads think they can pack some big bags,
        set sail for the quasiplane of Mineral, and strike it rich. What
        they forget, though, is that the realm's inhabited by some

        clouds, endless thunder, and (of course) vast arcs of lightning. If it weren't for the fact that a body can get himself
        fried in a second here, this would be a pretty nice place to
        sit back and admire the impressive scenery.
        The hazards of this quasiplane are more or less self-evident. Even though a sod can breathe here, he's got to deal
        with tremendous winds and deadly electrical discharges. Toss
        in the lightning quasielementals who populate the quasiplane, and the plane ends up as deadly as it is beautiful.

        They can be breathed safely and feel refreshing against the skin.
        As always, though, a body's got to take care. It's not
        that Steam has more dangerous creatures than any other

        stripped of its nurturing value by the influence of the Negative Energy Plane. This is exactly the process that has
        spawned the quasiplane of Salt.
        Here, in an endless world of crystalline structures, a visitor can expect to have the moisture drained right out of their
        body. Not long after reaching the quasiplane, he'll become
        parched and thirsty. In the end, even the toughest
        planewalker will collapse and be consumed by Salt. When

      The greatest threat a body faces from the quasiplane of

        Those who travel to the quasiplane of Ash find it an

      <p>The Outer Planes are planes of thought, of morality, of philosophy, of belief.  Gods exist in the outer planes as manifestations of one or more these concepts. They reside in the plane or planar layer that most closely resembles their beliefs.  There are 16 outer planes arranged in a circle based on alignment. Eight more or less line up with one of the eight possible alignments, while eight others fall between two bordering alignments.  In the middle, embodying pure neutrality, is the Outlands, with the city of Sigil sitting atop an infinite spire in the center.

      <p>The Seven Heavens is a plane of goodness and purity, from its bottom layer, where the Silvery Sea crashes melodiously against its shore, to the
          top layer, where radiance and benevolence dazzle all who arrive. It's said that even those of evil alignment are willingly suffered here, as
          long as they're looking to mend
          their vile ways.
          Mount Celestia's a place
          of beauty, all right - but it ain't
          no resting place. Those who
          come here work harder than
          almost anywhere else in the
          multiverse, because they've
          got to do it honestly, which means
          no shortcuts. People here have come to
          achieve perfection, and a body doesn't get
          to be perfect without work. Diligence isn't a
          trait that comes naturally to most.
          There's certain rules everyone's got to
          follow when they're on Mount Celestia, and the most
          important is that nothing here should be harmed, unless it's
          something evil intent on doing evil. A "good" berk who comes here slaughtering every "evil" thing in sight's going to get a big surprise when the high-ups
          among the archons come to investigate.</p>

      <p>Acheron has four layers, each made of enormous iron
      cubes floating in an airy void. Sometimes the cubes
      collide. Echoes of past collisions linger throughout the
      plane, mingling with the sounds of armies colliding.
      That's the nature of Acheron: strife and war, as the
      spirits of fallen soldiers join in endless battle against
      ores devoted to Gruumsh, goblinoids loyal to Maglubiyet,
      and legions assembled by other warmongering gods. </p>

      <img src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/forgottenrealms/images/d/d8/Modrons-mechanus-5e.jpg/revision" width="400">
      <p>On Mechanus, law is reflected in a realm of clockwork
      gears, all interlocked and turning according to their
      measure. The cogs seem to be engaged in a calculation
      so vast that no deity can fathom its purpose. Mechanus
      embodies absolute order, and its influence can be felt on
      those who spend time here. </p>
      <p>Modrons are the primary inhabitants of Mechanus.
      The plane is also home to the creator of the modrons: a
      godlike being called Primus.</p>
      <p>Inhabitants: modrons</p>

      <h3 id="arcadia">The Peacable Kingdoms of Arcadia</h3>
      <img src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/forgottenrealms/images/b/b2/Arcadia-3e.png">
      <p>Arcadia thrives with orchards of perfectly lined trees,
      ruler-straight streams, orderly fields, perfect roads, and
      cities laid out in geometrically pleasing shapes. The
      mountains are unblemished by erosion. Everything on
      Arcadia works toward the common good and a flawless
      form of existence. Here, purity is eternal, and nothing
      intrudes on harmony. </p>
      <p>Night and day are determined by an orb that floats
      above Arcadia's highest peak. Half of the orb radiates
      sunlight and brings about the day; the other half sheds
      moonlight and brings on the starry night. The orb
      rotates evenly without fail, spreading day and night
      across the entire plane. </p>
      <p>The weather in Arcadia is governed by four allied
    demigods called the Storm Kings: the Cloud King, the
    Wind Queen, the Lightning King, and the Rain Queen.
    Each one lives in a castle surrounded by the type of
    weather that king or queen controls. </p>
    <p>Hidden below Arcadia's beautiful mountains are
    numerous dwarven kingdoms that have withstood
    the passage of millennia.</p>
    <p>Inhabitants: dwarves, Aasimar</p>
      <h3 id="outlands">The Concordant Domain of the Outlands</h3>
      <hr class="b3">
      <img src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/emerald-isles/images/9/9a/Outlands.jpg" width="400">
      <p>The Outlands is the plane between the Outer Planes.
      It is the plane of neutrality, incorporating a little of
      everything and keeping all aspects in a paradoxical
      balance-simultaneously concordant and in opposition.
      The plane has varied terrain, with prairies, mountains,
      and shallow rivers. </p>
      <p>The Outlands is circular, like a great disk. In fact,
      those who envision the Outer Planes as a wheel point
      to the Outlands as proof, calling it a microcosm of the
      planes. That argument might be circular, since the
      arrangement of the Outlands inspired the idea of the
      Great Wheel in the first place. </p>
      <p>Around the outside edge of the circle, evenly spaced,
      are the gate-towns: sixteen settlements, each built
      around a portal leading to one of the Outer Planes. Each
      town shares many of the characteristics of the plane where its gate leads. Planar emissaries often meet in
      these towns, so it isn't unusual to see strange pairings,
      such as a celestial and a fiend arguing in a tavern while
      sharing a fine bottle of wine. </p>
      <p>Inhabitants: all playable races</p>

      <h3 id="astral">The Astral Plane</h3>
      <hr class="b3">
      <img src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/forgottenrealms/images/1/1b/Astral_plane-5e.jpg" width="400">
    <p>The Astral Plane is the realm of thought and dream,
    where visitors travel as disembodied souls to reach
    the Outer Planes. It is a great silvery sea, the same
    above and below, with swirling wisps of white and gray
    streaking among motes of light like distant stars. Most
    of the Astral Sea is a vast, empty expanse. Visitors
    occasionally stumble upon the petrified corpse of a dead god or other chunks of rock drifting forever in the
    silvery void. Much more commonplace are color poolsmagical pools of colored light that flicker like radiant,
    spinning coins. </p>
    <p>Creatures on the Astral Plane don't age or suffer from
      hunger or thirst. For this reason, humanoids that live
      on the Astral Plane (such as the githyanki) establish
      outposts on other planes, often the Material Plane, so
      their children can grow to maturity. </p>
    <p>Inhabitants: githyanki</p>
      <h3 id="ethereal">The Ethereal Plane</h3>
      <hr class="b3">
      <img src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/emerald-isles/images/4/44/Deep_Ethereal.jpg" alt="">
      <p>The Ethereal Plane is a misty, fog-bound dimension.
      Its "shores," called the Border Ethereal, overlap the
      Material Plane and the Inner Planes, so that every
      location on those planes has a corresponding location
      on the Ethereal Plane. Visibility in the Border Ethereal
      is limited to 60 feet. The plane's depths comprise a
      region of swirling mist and fog called the Deep Ethereal,
      where visibility is limited to 30 feet. </p>
      <p>Inhabitants: none</p>
      <h2 id="far">The Far Realm</h2>
      <hr class="b2">
      <img src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/forgottenrealms/images/5/54/Far_Realm_Neverwinter.jpg" width="400">
      <p>The Far Realm is outside the known multiverse. In
      fact, it might be an entirely separate universe with its
      own physical and magical laws. Where stray energies
      from the Far Realm leak onto another plane, matter
      is warped into alien shapes that defy understandable
      geometry and biology. Aberrations such as mind flayers
      and beholders are either from this plane or shaped by its
      strange influence.</p>
      <p>The entities that abide in the Far Realm itself are
      too alien for a normal mind to accept without strain.
      Titanic creatures swim through nothingness there, and
      unspeakable things whisper awful truths to those who
      dare listen. For mortals, knowledge of the Far Realm
      is a struggle of the mind to overcome the boundaries of
      matter, space, and sanity. Some warlocks embrace this
      struggle by forming pacts with entities there. Anyone who has seen the Far Realm mutters about eyes,
      tentacles, and horror. </p>
      <p>The Far Realm has no well-known portals, or at least
      none that are still viable. Ancient elves once opened a
      vast portal to the Far Realm within a mountain called
      Firestorm Peak, but their civilization imploded in bloody
      terror and the portal's location-even its home world-is
      long forgotten. Lost portals might still exist, marked by
      an alien magic that mutates the area around them. </p>
      <p>Inhabitants: none</p>
