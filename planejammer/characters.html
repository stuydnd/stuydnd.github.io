      <h1>How does my character fit into Planejammer?</h1>
      <hr class="b1">
      <h2>Plane or Crystal Sphere of origin</h2>
      <hr class="b2">
      Glance through the <a href="planes.html">planes page</a> or the <a href="spheres.html">crystal spheres page</a> and figure out where your character originated from.
      On the pages, it should list the typical inhabitants of those places.
      <h2>Planetouched</h2>
      <hr class="b2">
      Being descended from both mortals and extraplanar beings, known as "Planetouched" (such as Tieflings, Aasimar, and Genasi) are often attracted to other planes and planar travel.
      This makes these types of characters good fits for Planejammer.
      <h2>Setting-unique races and classes</h2>
      <hr class="b2">
      You can play a race or a class unique to settings such as Ravnica, Theros, Eberron, etc., as long as your character is from that world. (Loxodon characters must come from Ravnica, Warforged must come from Eberron.)
      The exceptions to this rule will be mentioned: for example, Leonin are listed as native to Trabarax, Loxodons are listed as native to Bytopia
      <h2>Race in Space</h2>
      <hr class="b3">
      Some spacefaring races are a little different from their terrestrial cousins. When you make a character belonging to one of these races, consider whether they are the groundling variety (as outlined in most official material), or their spacefaring counterparts:
      <ul id="spacerace">
        <li>Elves: The Elves of Wildspace are members of the Imperial Elven Navy, which commands Wildspace's largest fleet. The IEN have colonies on hundreds of worlds, and their compulsion to military service in the war with the Scro makes them fierce and disciplined.
          The Elves of the IEN are distrustful of Orcs in all varieties, but see themselves as superior to most races.</li>
        <li>Orcs: The Orcs of Planejammer, known as the Scro, are nothing like their groundling relatives. Though still barbaric in their violence, they live in an ordered society. They have long been at war with the IEN, who they view as their only obstacle in dominating all of Wildspace.</li>
        <li>Gnomes: The Tinker Gnomes of Planejammer are known for their love of Rube Goldberg mechanical devices. Their ships are filled with complex, and often useless devies that automate everything from getting out of bed to dispensing meals. </li>
      </ul>
      Use the high elf or wood elf subraces for IEN elves, and use Rock Gnomes as Tinker Gnomes.
      <h2>Backstory integration</h2>
      <hr class="b2">
      If you'd like to know how your character's backstory can be integrated into the campaign, just shoot me a message on Discord and I'll see what I can do.
