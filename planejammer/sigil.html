      <h1>About Sigil</h1>
      <hr class="b1">
      <p>
        One of the most important sites on the Outer Planes, Sigil (also known as the Cage or the City of Doors) is the largest center of commerce and most popular nexus of planar travel in the known multiverse. Its age and origins are unknown, as are the means of its existence, but its nature as a crossroads of all realms across existence ensures it holds a key role in planar society.
      </p>
      <p>Portals like those in Sigil exist all over the multiverse, linking distant planes to each other, but the concentration is highest in the Cage. This phenomenon makes Sigil one of the most coveted locations in the multiverse. Gods and fiends would love to take over, but Sigil is guarded by a being called the Lady of Pain, whose diligence bars would-be conquerors from entering the city. Those within the city that displease the Lady find themselves either flayed alive by her shadow or cast into Mazes from which few ever escape.</p>
      <p>Sigil is located at the top of the Spire, the infinitely-tall pillar in the center of the Outlands. Despite this fact, magic functions for the most part completely normally, with the anti-magic properties of the Outlands holding no sway over it. It occupies the inner surface of a ring or torus of approximately five miles in diameter, with gravity pointing outwards and allowing people within to walk about somewhat normally. Despite its size, however, the city is extremely crowded, with the total number occupying it at any one time far greater than the permanent population.

      <h2>the Lady of Pain</h2>
      <hr class="b2">
      <img src="https://i.imgur.com/aXi5Pj9.jpg" width="20%">
      <p>The Lady of Pain, Sigil's enigmatic ruler, only concerns herself with the crimes in Sigil she considers the most serious. Individials who violate these laws are banished to an extradimensional maze, from which there is no escape.
      <br>These laws include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Deities (or "powers") are forbidden from entering Sigil</li>
        <li>Worship of the Lady of Pain is forbidden</li>
        <li>No harm may come to the Rilmani (beings of pure neutrality, the same way Modrons are beings of order and demons are beings of evil)</li>
        <li>The Lady of Pain's rule in Sigil is absolute</li>
        <li>No more than 15 factions may operate in Sigil</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>day-to-day Govenment</h2>
      <hr class="b2">
      <h3>Legislation</h3>
      <p>The laws of the city are decided on by a council of representatives from each faction, moderated by the Sign of One at the Hall of Speakers. Any laws must be agreed upon by a majority of faction representatives to be put into place. The Fraternity of Order records the minutes of all meetings within the Hall of Speakers, and keeps ultimate records of all of Sigil's laws.</p>
      <p>The city treasury, as well as the collection of taxes for Sigilian city programs, is handled by the Fated. At present, all commerce within the city carries with it a flat 5% tax rate collected monthly, and all citizens must pay 3 copper per month or 10% of their total income over that month, whichever is greater, in addition to taxes on real estate, establishment permits, assemblies, eyesores, and other intangibles. (Most citizens without the money to hire an accountant or that simply don't care to track income merely pay the 3 copper monthly tax, though for those skirting the line audits are occasionally enforced, usually to the benefit of the Fated.) An unofficial exception is usually made for the Hive, considering the risk to tax collectors there, but some still make the effort.</p>
      <br>
      <h3>Enforcement</h3>
      <p>Enforcement of the laws of Sigil is handled by a combination of three factions, the factions of Law. The physical enforcement is left to the Harmonium, who serve as the city guard and, when necessary, the militia. (Arming of the Harmonium is officially provided by contract by the Doomguard, who run the majority of forges in Sigil as well as the City Armory.) When an individual is arrested, the Fraternity of Order is responsible for trying the case, as well as providing a public defender for those with insufficient income to have a personal barrister. Those convicted are then transferred to the care of the Mercykillers, who handle sentencing. In the case of a fine, the Mercykillers are to be paid, and 90% of the fine is then sent to the city treasury, with the remaining 10% distributed amongst the three factions of Law. If jail time is given, the offender is either held in the City Prison, or one of the Mercykillers' labor camps on Acheron, depending on the status of the prisoner and remaining capacity of the Prison. If the sentence is death, the Mercykillers are responsible for executions; as of late, the Mercykillers have begun making executions public within the Prison courtyard, with all citizens invited to observe. Depending on the level of the crime, executions consist either of beheading by axe, or consumption by the Mercykiller Wyrm.</p>
      <h2>Districts</h2>
      <hr class="b2">
      <ul>
        <li>Clerk's Ward: An affluent district, home to most of the city's lower-rung bureaucrats and middlemen.</li>
        <li>Guildhall Ward: Home to the traders, craftsmen, artisans, guild members and other members of the middle class.</li>
        <li>The Hive: The slum and the ghetto, home to the poor, the rogues, and the unwanted dregs of the city.</li>
        <li>The Lady's Ward: the location of the City Barracks, the Court, the Armory and the Jail, the Lady's Ward is the home of the government, as well as the elite and rich of Sigil.</li>
        <li>Lower Ward: An industrial district, clogged up with the smoke from the foundries and from the portals to the Lower Planes.</li>
        <li>Market Ward: The main location for purchasing goods and services</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The Market Ward is home to Mert's, a tavern frequented by planeswalkers. Although its ale is known to be of fine quality, what sets Mert's apart is the portal in the third stall of the men's restroom leading to the Department of Spelljamming Vehicles in the City of Bral.</p>
