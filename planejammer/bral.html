      <h1>About the Rock of Bral</h1>
      <hr class="b1">

      <p>
        The Rock of Bral is an asteroid that drifts between the triangular area of Known Space, between Realmspace, Krynnspace and Greyspace. Bral, the city located on the asteroid, is a bustling trade center. Due to its location near the center of Known Space, all manner of species trade in Bral.<br>
        The major power groups that govern Bral are the human aristocracy, the elves of the Imperial Elven Navy, the Dwarves who settled on Bral over half a millennium ago, the illithids, and the neogi, a race of eel-spiders known for dealing in the slave trade (although selling slaves is not permitted in Bral).<br>
        The illithids (also known as the Mind Flayers) are regarded as the most impartial of these groups, and often settle disputes. The Mercane are influential in trade, but not as much politically.
      </p>
      <h2>History of Bral</h2>
      <hr class="b2">
      <p>Archeological evidence suggests that the earliest settlers on the Rock of Bral were the illithids and the beholders, but that these initial settlers wiped each other out at some point around 1,000 years ago. Then, around 600 years ago, a few dwarven clans settled on the Rock, but they still numbered few.</p>
      <p>272 years ago, (1227 DR/224 AC/447 CY), the pirate captain Bral, ignoring rumors of haunted space at the center of the Known Space, stumbled upon the Rock of Bral while searching for a hideout.
        A charismatic leader and brilliant tactician,
        Captain Bral soon assembled a small fleet of corsairs known as the Black Brotherhood. A town
        grew up around the port as more people and races
        came to settle and to build. Many were rogues and
        thieves, but some were merchants and entrepreneurs. The Rock was a lawless town of endless revelry and unchecked duelling.
        Bral himself came to a bad end, leading a raid of
        five ships against a groundling city. Although the
        raid went well, the elven fleet was waiting for him
        in orbit. Eight men o’ war attacked and only one
        ship of the pirate flotilla escaped. Bral himself
        perished as his vipership, the <i>Starwind</i>, fell in a
        glorious blaze to the world he had just raided. In
        honor of the great pirate, the citizens threw a wild
        wake and promptly named the city for him. The
        city became known as Bral, and its asteroid as the
        Rock of Bral.
        For almost 60 years after Bral‘s death, the Rock
        remained largely unchanged in character. The city
        grew slowly, climbing up the topside from the old
        pirate lairs. No one tried to impose order on .the
        town, and most people were content to live that
        way. The pirate captains ruled the city by popular
        consensus.
      </p>
      <p>Around 150 years ago, Bral came to the point where most of its inhabitants were merchants rather than pirates. A captain named Cozar eventually consolidated power and began the ruling house of Cozar.</p>
      <h2>Government of Bral</h2>
      <hr class="b2">
      <p>Bral is governed by three primary councils.
        <ol>
          <li>The Council of the City consists of 30 councilmen appointed for life by the ruling Prince. They advise the Prince on ruling matters, and have the power to overturn a royal decree through a unanimous vote, though this has never happened.</li>
          <li>The Council of Captains meet once a month to regulate trade, tariffs, and exchange rates. The Council of Captains consists of wealthy landowners who each control at least 5 spelljammers.</li>
          <li>The Noble Council only meet once every 3-4 years. They have the power to disenfranchise any landowner.</li>
        </ol>
        When someone discovers a crime, they go to the Magistrate, who in turn dispatch the Magistrate's Watch to apprehend the criminal.<br>
        <br>note: the Underside is the prison on the underside of the Rock of Bral, Jettisoning refers to being ejected into the void of space.
      </p>
      <h2>Crime</h2>
      <hr class="b2">
      <p>Due to the organization of the justice system in Bral, many crimes go unnoticed by the Magistrate. This makes Bral a city with more than its fair share of criminal activity.
        The Underbarons are the criminal lords of the
        city, each sitting at the center of a web of theft, extortion, gambling, drinking, and any number of other illicit activities. They are the fences, financiers,
        and the neighborhood patrons. The Rock of Bral is
        divided into their territories, and they constantly
        scheme and maneuver to keep their own positions
        secure while attacking those of their rivals. </p>
