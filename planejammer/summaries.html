      <h3>Session 1: summary written by Vincent, November 3rd</h3>
      <hr class="b3">
      <p>The party begins in a tavern, all waiting for a contact in the Free League. Not many people are in the tavern due to the current elections. They find out from the barkeep that something has recently happened, and that he's rather down in the dumps. They leave the tavern to his home, which happens to be labeled with a lot of propaganda about not voting. They knock, and they find out that his son is missing, they head to where the contact believes his son dissapeared, The Swamp of Oblivion. Here they meet a little more than friendly slime who is trying to restart the economy after the main source of revenue in the area was removed, as Juiblex, a demon lord, has seemingly disappeared. He tries selling the party old and rusty tools for cheap, but eventually decides to go with the party after they express their disinterest. He leads them through a forest with a witch in it who seems to be finding a lot higher quality items than their new slime friend, heading towards a government facility. They end up finding lizard people following them, and they request a sacrifice from them to the one who owns this forest. The party follows the lizard people upon request, and make sacrifices of dances, knives, and blood. These are... accepted, and they are allowed to sleep in the definitely not ominous cave. The leader follows them inside, and the party looks behind them to find a green dragon. They try fighting, but soon realize that it probably won't work, and work out a bargain to get the dragon some weed from the witch in return for not dying. They head off to the witch, and one of the warlocks in the party casts invisibility, taking the weed and handing it to the party, taking as much as they can carry. The witch leaves the home as the party is leaving, and tries to summon a zombie to stop them, to no avail. They head back to the dragon and give them the weed, and go back off towards the facility. They eventually make it, and impersonate some of the agents to make it in inside.

      <h3>Session 2: summary written by Vincent (in-character), November 9th</h3>

      Day Three?
      I don't know how long we've been in 'ere, it looks like the sky doesn't move like normal in here. We entered the facility today, and we got caught. We fought hard, but after lobbing a bolt at a guard I realized there was no way we could fight them. Sons a' bitches were imprisoning random people 'ere. I called em out, and they gave up soon enough. Didn't really feel like lobbin' more bolts at em, granted I could probably take out a few of em before we all went down. We took the drunkards son outta here, but this gods damned bird bloke followed us, I tried tellin' him off, but he just flew off, watchin us. We went off towards that old hags house in the woods, and found some o' those lizard folk from the dragon we worked for. They seemed to fightin' some sorta war about that "weed" thing we took from the old hag. We left em, and I found this... mud with an amulet in it. Thing was movin! I took it with me spectral hand, but the damned thing came alive! I flew up and lobbed some bolts at it, and it fell apart. Didn't know the thing wasn't actually dead. Noticed the bird still followin us, so I told em off and they flew off ahead of us. We took a rest, since the drunkards son was tired. Weak bugger. I took first watch, didn't feel right. The mud monster appeared in the trees while we slept, so I flew up and lobbed some more bolts at it. I decided it would be better to just give back the damned amulet, so I dropped it onto it. Big mistake. It grew to like the size of a buildin'! I lobbed some more bolts at it, and one of me pals lobbed some too. It ran off, didn't bother us again. We continued restin'.
      <br><br>Day Four?
      We kept walkin' and found another one of the lizard folk, this time he was bleedin' out. We helped him back to his camp, but he was dead before we made it. May his soul find rest. We continued on, finding the old hag, and they were angry at us for stealing their... "weed." A lizard folk with his dying breath, bless him, stabbed em in the back, killin' em. They tried cursin' us, but didn't have the components. Glad the old hag was dead. We headed back to town, and the leader from the government buildin' was on the other side, making his political speech about being elected, blah blah blah. We moved on to return the man from the Free League's (Drunkard) son. He gave us a letter of recommendation, and we were in once we brought it to a fellow of his. The nice fellow gave us an option for healthcare, of which only some of me blokes took, I personally declined, not gon' make a choice for my future lives. Mark on yer soul and all that, not for me. We left and went to the job board, and decided to head on to help some man get his son back from another faction.
