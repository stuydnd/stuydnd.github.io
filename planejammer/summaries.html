      <h3>Session 1: summary written by Vincent, November 3rd</h3>
      <hr class="b3">
      <p>The party begins in a tavern, all waiting for a contact in the Free League. Not many people are in the tavern due to the current elections. They find out from the barkeep that something has recently happened, and that he's rather down in the dumps. They leave the tavern to his home, which happens to be labeled with a lot of propaganda about not voting. They knock, and they find out that his son is missing, they head to where the contact believes his son dissapeared, The Swamp of Oblivion. Here they meet a little more than friendly slime who is trying to restart the economy after the main source of revenue in the area was removed, as Juiblex, a demon lord, has seemingly disappeared. He tries selling the party old and rusty tools for cheap, but eventually decides to go with the party after they express their disinterest. He leads them through a forest with a witch in it who seems to be finding a lot higher quality items than their new slime friend, heading towards a government facility. They end up finding lizard people following them, and they request a sacrifice from them to the one who owns this forest. The party follows the lizard people upon request, and make sacrifices of dances, knives, and blood. These are... accepted, and they are allowed to sleep in the definitely not ominous cave. The leader follows them inside, and the party looks behind them to find a green dragon. They try fighting, but soon realize that it probably won't work, and work out a bargain to get the dragon some weed from the witch in return for not dying. They head off to the witch, and one of the warlocks in the party casts invisibility, taking the weed and handing it to the party, taking as much as they can carry. The witch leaves the home as the party is leaving, and tries to summon a zombie to stop them, to no avail. They head back to the dragon and give them the weed, and go back off towards the facility. They eventually make it, and impersonate some of the agents to make it in inside.
