      <p>
        This is the website for my Planejammer campaign.
        It incorporates elements from the Second Edition campaign setting of Spelljammer, which was essentially "D&amp;D in Space" and elements from the Planescape setting, which focused on adventured outside the Material Plane and solidified the D&amp;D cosmology as we know it today.
        <br><br>While technically set in the same universe as my campaign last year, Out of the Abyss, Planejammer has a wider scope, focusing on multiple planets and planes of existence instead of just one world.
      <br><br>While there is information readily available on the web concerning the Spelljammer and Planescape settings, the only official source of info for this campaign is from this website, as I will be making modifications.
      Some of the stuff in the old campaign settings doesn't fit my vision, while other stuff has aged rather poorly.
      <br><br>Expand the sidebar to learn more about the campaign.

      <h2>What to know in advance</h2>
      <hr class="b2">
      <h3>Sigil</h3>
      <hr class="b3">
        <img src="https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/forgottenrealms/images/2/21/Sigil_by_night.jpg" alt="Sigil" height="200px"/>
      <p>The campaign begins in the city of <a href="sigil.html">Sigil</a>.
      Before the first proper session, you should have an idea of how long your character has been in Sigil. Were they born there, or did they stumble in through a portal the week before?
      Also think about why your character is in Sigil. Did they seek it out after hearing about it, or did they accidentally wander in and decide to settle there?</p>

      <h3>Death &amp; Resurrection</h3>
      <hr class="b3">
      This campaign adds an alternate resurrection method. In the D&amp;D multiverse, upon death, a soul travels to a plane corresponding with the individual's alignment, where they are resurrected. In Planejammer, you can travel to that plane, and bring them back (Further stuff is required, but that will be explored in-game).
