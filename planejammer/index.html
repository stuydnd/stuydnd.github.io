      <p>
        This is the website for my Planejammer campaign.
        It incorporates elements from the Second Edition campaign setting of Spelljammer, which was essentially "D&amp;D in Space" and elements from the Planescape setting, which focused on adventures outside the Material Plane and solidified the D&amp;D cosmology as we know it today.
        <br><br>While technically set in the same universe as my campaign last year, Out of the Abyss, Planejammer has a wider scope, focusing on multiple planets and planes of existence instead of just one world. Planejammer is set in the year 1499 DR, 9 years after the conclusion of Out of the Abyss.
      <br><br>While there is information readily available on the web concerning the Spelljammer and Planescape settings, the only official source of info for this campaign is from this website, as I will be making modifications.
      Some of the stuff in the old campaign settings doesn't fit my vision, while other stuff has aged rather poorly.
      <br><br>Expand the sidebar to learn more about the campaign.

      <h2>What to know in advance</h2>
      <hr class="b2">
      <h3>Sigil</h3>
      <hr class="b3">
        <img src="https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/forgottenrealms/images/2/21/Sigil_by_night.jpg" alt="Sigil" height="200px"/>
      <p>The campaign begins in the city of <a href="sigil.html">Sigil</a>.
      Before the first proper session, you should have an idea of how long your character has been in Sigil. Were they born there, or did they stumble in through a portal the week before?
      Also think about why your character is in Sigil. Did they seek it out after hearing about it, or did they accidentally wander in and decide to settle there?</p>

      <h3>Death &amp; Resurrection</h3>
      <hr class="b3">
      This campaign adds an alternate resurrection method. In the D&amp;D multiverse, upon death, a soul travels to a plane corresponding with the individual's alignment, where they are resurrected.
      In Planejammer, you can travel to that plane, and bring them back (Further stuff is required, but that will be explored in-game).
      In the meantime, the player can use a temporary character (for example a relative of their temporarily-deceased character who tries to bring them back).
      <h3>INSP and Session Summaries</h3>
      <hr class="b3">
      INSP is a metric that will be used to get Inspiration & other 'rewards'. 10 INSP gets you 1 re-roll. 15 INSP gets you Inspiration. Writing a session summary yields 5 INSP, or 10 INSP if written in character. Session summaries will be posted on the <a href="summaries.html">summaries page</a>. I'll also dispense INSP for smaller rp related things.
      <h3>Factions</h3>
      <hr class="b3">
      As a group, you'll need to pick a faction to join before the first session. Check the <a href="factions.html">factions page</a> for information about each faction.
      <h3>About this website</h3>
      <hr class="b3">
      While much of the text on this website is taken from other sources, there may be some alterations, so this website is the only reliable source of lore for the campaign.
