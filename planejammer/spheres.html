      <hr class="b3">
      <p>Size H, Spherical Fire Body</p>
      <p>The sun of Realmspace, like that of most other solar systems, is a giant ball of fire in the center of the sphere. It is dotted with are hundreds of small gateways to the elemental plane of Fire. Through these planar doors come the countless fire-loving creatures that inhabit its surface.</p>
      <p>No known magical item can allow a creature native to the Prime Material plane to survive here for more than a few seconds. Due to this reason, the Sun is mostly unexplored by the natives of this sphere.</p>
      <p>Around the sun, orbit a dozen magic-dead zones. These large spheres are about 40 million miles from the primary, close to the obit of Anadia. They are invisible, and make travel near the Sun slightly dangerous.</p>
      <h3 id="anadia">Anadia</h3>
      <hr class="b3">
      <img src="http://www.spelljammer.org/worlds/Realmspace/pics/Anadia2.gif">
      <p>Size B, Spherical Earth Body</p>
      <p>Anadia is a small, desert world inhabited by halflings and desert-dwelling monsters.</p>
      <p>In the south halfling culture as disintegrated into a series of clan wars. These clans are fiercely loyal to their members, but unwilling to compromise with the other clans surrounding them. Outsider tends to be viewed in terms of their effect on this warfare as potential allies, mercenaries, or victims. The inter-clan warfare has begun to take a more deadly turn as various Spelljammer factions begin to meddle in the turmoil. Many Southern Polarate halflings have begun to appear on spelljamming vessels as fierce, clannish mercenaries. They seldom hire out as individuals, instead whole clans seem to emigrate into space attempting to escape the constant warfare on their home world. These tend to be the smaller clans, numbering usually from 20-200 adults warriors. Southern Polarate halfling mercenaries use their traditional weapons; daggers and Anadian Flintlocks. They usually wear leather armor. </p>
      <p>The Northern Polarate is the south's polar opposite socially as well as geographically. Traditional, democratic halfling counties are the norm here, they exist under a central government known as the Counties of North Anadia (usually simply "North Anadia" or "Anadia". The current leader of this nation is Governor Fjord Deepskull, a wise politician who as served for the past 70 years. This is quite a feat considering that he must run for reelection every five years. Fjord was instrumental in debunking the old spacer myths about Anadian "idiot" reservations for non-halflings. There few non-halflings in North Anadia because everything is built halfling size, larger races consider it uncomfortable and seldom stay long ( a few non-halfling hermits live in their own houses in the countryside-their reticence in speaking with visitors is what caused the idiot reservation rumors). </p>
      <p>Inhabitants: halflings</p>
      <h3 id="coliar">Coliar</h3>
      <hr class="b3">
      <img src="http://www.spelljammer.org/worlds/Realmspace/pics/Coliar-Atmosphere.jpg" alt="">
      <p>Size G, Spherical Air Body</p>
      <p>This large air world is filled with literally hundreds of floating land masses, "islands". These revolve around the planets geometric center at varying altitudes and speeds, but the average "day" is about 30 hours. Centuries of revolution have caused all of the immediate collisions to occur, none of the islands are currently headed for each other. These islands vary in size from a few miles across up to 100 miles across, and share similar ecological systems. All have swampy or jungle like lowlands interspersed with abrupt, rocky mountains. A few of the larger islands actually support a prairie system.</p>
      <p>Coliar is interesting in that there are no mammal species native to the planet—reptiles, dinosaurs, and birds are the dominant life forms. Because of the relatively limited food sources available for terrestrial creatures the larger dinosaur types never developed Tyrannosaurus or Brachiosaurus are unknown on Coliar. The planet is inhabited instead by a multitude of bird species (similar to familiar earth species like sparrows, hawks, ect), many small to medium sized dinosaurs, and reptile species.</p>
      <p>Inhabitants: Aarakocra, kenku, lizardfolk, kobolds</p>
      <h3 id="toril">Toril</h3>
      <hr class="b3">
      <img src="http://www.spelljammer.org/worlds/Realmspace/pics/Selune.gif" alt="">
      <p>Size E, Spherical Earth Body</p>
      <p>While far from the largest planet in the sphere, Toril boasts the sphere's largest population of sentient beings. It is also the most diverse population, nearly every type of thinking creature found in the multiverse has lived on Toril at one time or another. This planet dominates the sphere politically and economically, and it is only its own disunity which prevents it from dominating militarily as well.</p>
      <p>The world is primarily water covered, with several large land masses on which the primary political entities reside. By far the largest of these land masses rests in the northern hemisphere of the planet, and is divided into three continents. The western continent is known as "Faerun", the eastern "Kara-tur", and the southern "Zakhara". The region in the center, a desolate plain which divides the three much as an ocean would, is known as the Hordelands.</p>
      <p>In addition to this main landmass, another, smaller pair of attached continents exists across the sea, the southern portion of this pair is known as Maztica, and the northern Anchrome. They are seperated by a harsh desert. Finally several large islands also exist and support native kingdoms.</p>
      <p>Spelljamming is relatively common on Toril, meaning on the average one in a thousand inhabitants have heard of it. This knowledge is not widespread geographically, either, knowledge of spelljamming varies widely not only between continents but even between neighboring cultures. It is thus impossible to generalize concerning attitudes towards spelljamming on the planet. For this reason each continent will be considered seperately, and to varying degrees depending on the spelljamming knowledge possessed by its indigenous population.</p>
      <p>Toril was the setting for last year's campaign, Out of the Abyss</p>
      <p>Inhabitants: all races found in the Player's Handbook and Volo's Guide to Monsters</p>

      <p>Size D, Spherical water body</p>
      <p>Karpri is a water worlds inhabited by aquatic elves and gnomes at the poles, but the inhabitants of Karpri are not Spelljamming-capable, and refuse to interact with Spelljamming societies.</p>
      <p>Inhabitants: gnomes, sea elves</p>
      <h3 id="chandos">Chandos</h3>

      <img src="http://www.spelljammer.org/worlds/Realmspace/pics/Chandos2.jpg" alt="">
      <p>Size F, Spherical water body</p>
      <p>Chandos, the fifth planet in the
      Realmspace solar system, is a large water body
      with no moon. The water is filled with irregular
      chunks of rocks, laid one upon another. These
      rocks, when piled high enough, pierce the water
      level, forming irregular and unstable islands.
      There are several hundred of these islands in existence at all times, and these are where the human, dwarf, and orc populations make their
      homes.</p>
      <p>The planetary surface is continually changing: Chandos has been compared to a box of marbles filled with water. As the planet rotates,
      which it does every 48 hours, the randomly
      shaped rocks shift. This can make complete is.
      lands disappear, caverns and tunnels can be
      come flooded or inverted, and mountains can
      be raised in a single day. All these changes
      makes the Chandos inhabitants nomadic. There
      is never a safe place when the land changes.
      Even the weather changes the land.</p>
      <p>Inhabitants: dwarves, humans, orcs</p>

      <p>Glyth is the sixth planet in the
      Realms' solar system, and it is a sad world in.
      deed. The atmosphere is so foul that entering it
      reminds visitors of a charnel house or a dead forest during a severe fire. In fact, forest fires do
      regularly sweep across the charred surface of
      the planet, burning anything that had the opportunity to get a foothold in the soil. What forests
      do remain are in control of the underground-
      dwelling inhabitants of the planet. The rest are
      purposely burned off to limit the possible hiding
      places for their runaway cattle.</p>
      <p>Eighty percent of the planet is land, while the
      other 20% consists of a mysterious gelatinous
      substance. This substance contains a large
      quantity of water, but the feel is similar to gela-
      tin. If this gelatin is eaten, it safely satisfies any
      thirst as if it were water. The positive thing about
      this strange gelatinous water is that it never
      turns brackish like regular water, nor does it
      freeze.</p>
      <p>Glyth has a large ring that orbits the planet at
      the equator. This beautiful feature can be seen
      clearly from the planet's surface both day and
      night. During the day, the ring looks similar to a
      perfectly formed cloud, with sharp edges. During the night, soft oranges, reds, and blues can
      be seen in its spiraling arcs. It often casts a weak
      shadow onto the planet during the daytime as
      well.</p>

      <p>Garden, the seventh planet from
      the Sun, has 12 small Class A earth bodies revolving around it. The planet itself is actually a
      cluster of earth bodies lying relatively close together, anchored to each other by the roots of a
      gargantuan plant. Each share a common atmospheric envelope. The 12 moons, however, are
      well outside the spherical reaches of the atmosphere.</p>

      <p>The planet consists of a flat 300‑mile-thick (480‑kilometer) disc of clear water with a single mountain in the center.

Over 1,000 miles (1,600 kilometers) tall and 200 miles (320 kilometers) wide at its base, the Spindle is the tallest mountain in all of Realmspace.</p>

      <h3 id="oerth">Oerth</h3>
      <hr class="b3">
      <img src="https://usercontent.one/wp/www.annabmeyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screenshot-2020-04-13-17.10.08-1024x871.jpg" width="400">
      <p>Size, Spherical earth body</p>
      <p>Oerth is the center of the Greyspace system, both
      geometrically and sociologically. As the primary,
      every other celestial body in the system orbits
      around it, including Liga, "the sun."</p>
      <p>From space, Oerth is a placid-looking blue-white
      world, beautiful and delicate. At a distance, it is difficult to distinguish between land and sea. The entire
      surface of the planet takes on a bluish cast, due to the
      large oceans. Clouds create sweeping, swirling pat:
      terns of white, punctuated here and there by circular
      funnel-storms. Closer in, it is possible to make out the
      landmasses, see forests and deserts, and spot the major mountain ranges. So far, human and humanoid civihizations on Oerth have been unable to change their
      environment extensively enough for their presence to
      be seen from space. (For comparison, on the world of
      Toril in Realmspace, the only manmade structure visible from space is the Dragonwall.)</p>
      <p>The geocentric nature of Greyspace reinforces the
      very natural sense of superiority displayed by many
      Oerth natives. Historically, all primitive cultures believe that their town, then their country, and eventually their world, is the center of the universe. As they
      become more sophisticated, most cultures learn the
      fallacy of this view. In the case of Oerth, however, reality has actually reinforced their worldview. Oerth is the center of the Greyspace system, and everything
      else revolves around that world, physically and figuratively.</p>
